# Reducing News Reading Time with Transformer-Based Summaries

## Objective
In today’s fast-paced world, a constant stream of news makes it difficult for people to stay informed—especially about political events—without spending a lot of time reading full articles. The goal is to help users quickly grasp key information without sacrificing understanding.

## Solution
To address this issue, I will develop an automatic news summarization system that generates concise and informative summaries using deep learning techniques. The solution centers on Transformer-based models, which have proven to outperform traditional architectures like LSTMs in NLP tasks, providing faster and more accurate access to essential content.
